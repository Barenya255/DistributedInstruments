#Open MPI

- Message Passing Interface is a framework that allows parallel programming via passing messages.
- OpenMPI is an implementation of the MPI framework, maintained by several Universities worldwide

#About the Project

- The goal is to understand better message passing(real time) accross machines(over a LAN)
- The master can type in a music score and the same will be played in the various worker machines accross the LAN
- This will be a good demonstration of distributed computing using OpenMPI.
